## Problem Statement
The idea is based on emitra. In the country like india we need Emitra more in rural area rather than urban area. So we are planning to build it on very simple platform for network purposes. We believe it should be simpler with very less clicks by the use of Artificial Intelligence. Our team will try to build this application looking the rural area in mind, we will be going to power this application with the connectivity as its required in rural, idea is about better connectivity, simplicity, secure and reliable link by making the transaction secure. This application will solve problems like connecting rural people with NGO and SHG.

## Project Description
The Idea of the prototype Presented is to make the connection between government and public easier safer reliable and secure. And for this, we present a prototype. In which user will experience the very easy way to make most out of it. This platform will be presented on atm like touch screen panel.

As we seek need that in order to make India digital we have to make the poor and rular area people digital too and for that these touch screens panels will only be access by the aadhar id and fingerprints as a credential. Now on the basis of location and area in which he/she stays panel is going to show a tab SERVICES in which there will more tabs related to various government scheme. Along with the service the plan is to put the other tabs like payment ,RTI,Education and a jobs portal too. As you enter in the payment tab if your electricity bill is linked with the bank as well as with aadhar id then directly amount is going to show for various household services.and in very few clicks person can make secure payment.

As we know that our India is developing fast with technology but one thing in which we are HAVING A HARD TIME IS development in rural areas The young children have to work hard in term to get knowledge We can change this by using our Portal by connecting them with government.
